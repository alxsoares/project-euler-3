We can assume without loss of generality that the radii of the circles is 1.

As a result, the area of the L-section is (1**2 - Pi*(1**2)/4).

The cartesian formula of the line is y1 = x*(1/n).

The cartesian formula of the circle's left-bottom edge is :
(1-y)**2 + (1-x)**2 = 1 or y2 = 1-sqrt[1-(1-x)**2].

Since y1 is consistently increasing and y2 is consistently decreasing, we
can find the approximate x where y1 = y2 by using bisection or similar.
