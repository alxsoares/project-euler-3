We can assume without loss of generality that the radii of the circles is 1.

As a result, the area of the L-section is (1**2 - Pi*(1**2)/4).

The cartesian formula of the line is y1 = x*(1/n).

The cartesian formula of the circle's left-bottom edge is :
(1-y)**2 + (1-x)**2 = 1 or y2 = 1-sqrt[1-(1-x)**2].

Since y1 is consistently increasing and y2 is consistently decreasing, we
can find the approximate x where y1 = y2 by using bisection or similar.

Based on the point (x1, y1) we can find the area of the concave triangle by
splitting it into two parts based on the line (x1,0)-(x1,y1).

The area of the left part is simply x1*y1/2.

The area of the right part is the area of the trumboid minus the one of the
circle's pie slice.

The area of the trumboid is (y1+1)*(1-x1)/2 .

The area of the pie slice is arcsin[(1-x1)/1]/(2*Pi)*Pi*(R=1)**2 =
arcsin[1-x1]/2 .
