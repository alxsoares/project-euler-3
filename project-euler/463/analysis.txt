The function f is defined for all positive integers as follows:

    f(1)=1
    f(3)=3
    f(2n)=f(n)
    f(4n+1)=2f(2n+1)−f(n)
    f(4n+3)=3f(2n+1)−2f(n)

The function S(n) is defined as ∑_n^i=1[f(i)].

S(8)=22 and S(100)=3604.

Find S(3^37). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.

f(2**n) = 1
f(3*2**n) = 3

f(1) = 1
f(2) = 1
f(3) = 3
f(4) = 1

f(5) = f(4*1+1) = 2*f(2*1+1)-f(1) = 6-1 = 5
