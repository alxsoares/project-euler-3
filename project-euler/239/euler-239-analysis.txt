There are 25 primes between 1 and 100. As a result, exactly 3 primes are in
their right place.

Let's say that $i = the number of primes out of the 22 that are found in
non-prime positions.

If $i = 0 :
-----------

All primes are in prime-numbered positions, just not in the correct place.
The lowest of these primes has 21 options to be placed in. The prime that it
was placed at can be placed
