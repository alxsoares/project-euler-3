We are interested in 1777 ** (1777 ↑↑ 1854) % 1e8 . Now, (1777 ** n % 1e8)
has a cycle, because for some n, ( (1777 ** n) % 1e8 ) == 1. Let's call this
cycle $m.

Now we are interested in (1777 ↑↑ 1854) % $m. This is
1777 ** (1777 ↑↑ 1853) % $m . This too has a cycle which we'll call $t ,
so we check 1777 ** (1777 ↑↑ 1852) % $t, and so on.
