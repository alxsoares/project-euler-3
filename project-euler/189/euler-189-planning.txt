Planning:
=========

* The colours of the rows will be stored as vec($s,$pos,2) with a tri-state.

* We will keep an array (indexed by height) of hashes of the sequence of the
bottom edges of rows including the count for each one.

* Also a map of Height -> Permutation of Height colours -> Permutation
of Height+1 colours in the row below -> Num of such for each.
