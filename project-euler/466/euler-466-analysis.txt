In the 1st row of P(64, 10^16), we have { n*1 | n \in {1 .. 10^16 } }
so 10^16 distinct numbers.

In the 2nd row of P(64, 10^16), we have { n*2 | n \in {1 .. 10^16 } },
but the lower half of them is less than 10^16 so we get an additional
(10^16)/2 numbers.

In the 3rd row of P(64, 10^16), we have { n*3 | n \in {1 .. 10^16 } },
but:

    A) {n*3 | n \in {1 .. 10^16/3 } is already in the first row.

    B) {n*3 | n*3 < 2*10^16 && n % 2 == 0 } is already in the second row.
