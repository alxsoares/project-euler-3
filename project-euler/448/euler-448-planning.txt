Each lcm(i,n) contributes lcm(i,n)/n to the total which = i*n/(n*gcd(i,n)) =
= i/gcd(i,n) .

For i = 1 ; A' = 1,1,1,1,1...
For i = 2 ; A' =   1,2,1,2...
For i = 3 ; A' =     1,3,3,1,3,3,1...
For i = 4 ; A' =       1,4,2,4,1,4,2,4...
For i = 5 ; A' =         1,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,1...
For i = 6 ; A' =          [1,6,3,2,3,6]

It has a cycle of length "i". Each element that corresponds to i/gcd(i,n)
appears when gcd(i,n') = a which happens
